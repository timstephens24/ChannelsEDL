# ChannelsDVR EDL 

This is a quick script to copy the edl files that ChannelsDVR creates and put it right next to the file for use with apps like Kodi.  It also changes the EDL Skip Field from a '0' (Cut) to a '3' (Commerical Break) for easier use in case ComSkip wasn't 100% accurate.

[ChannelsDVR](https://getchannels.com) is the most family friendly cord cutting tool you can have in your arsenal. It has simple and familiar ways to both browse and control TV.
